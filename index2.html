          <h2>Manage EMI</h2>
          <p class="left-align">Few people realize the amount of money they pay as interest to the bank on their loans. By increasing the EMI that you pay on your loan by a small amount, you can reduce the tenure of your loan as well as save money.<br>For a 25 Lakh loan at an interest rate of 10.5%, you pay an approximate EMI of Rs. 25000 per month for 20 years. You end up paying around 59.6 lakh rupees. Now, assume the interest rate remains constant at 10.5%. By just increasing your EMI by 500, i.e. a total EMI of 25,500, the total amount paid reduces to about 57.1 lakh rupees. That is a saving of about 2.5 lakh. Not only that, your loan gets repaid faster by about 15 months!! Try for yourself by using our tool. Click the button below.
